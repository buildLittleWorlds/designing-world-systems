# Chapter 1: Decomposition - Breaking Down Worlds

In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of decomposition and how it applies to world-building. We'll cover:

- Understanding decomposition in design systems
- Applying decomposition to world-building
- Practical techniques for decomposing your fictional worlds

Decomposition is a fundamental principle in design systems that allows us to break complex structures into smaller, more manageable components. By applying this principle to world-building, we can create rich, detailed universes that are both internally consistent and easily expandable.

As we journey through this chapter, we'll see how decomposition can help us tackle the daunting task of creating entire worlds, making the process more systematic and less overwhelming. We'll draw parallels between the world of front-end development and the art of crafting fictional universes, showing how the techniques used in one field can inspire and inform the other.

Let's begin our exploration of decomposition and discover how it can transform your approach to world-building.
