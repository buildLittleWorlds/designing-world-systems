# Chapter 3: Design Tokens - The Fundamental Building Blocks of Worlds

In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of design tokens and how they can be applied to world-building. We'll cover:

- Understanding design tokens in design systems
- Applying design token principles to world-building
- Practical techniques for creating and using design tokens in fictional universes

Design tokens are the fundamental atoms of design systems, representing the smallest units of design decisions. In world-building, they become the basic building blocks from which entire universes are constructed.

As we journey through this chapter, we'll see how design tokens can help us create consistent, flexible, and deeply realized fictional worlds. We'll draw inspiration from the use of design tokens in digital design and apply these principles to the art of crafting immersive universes.

Let's begin our exploration of design tokens and discover how they can provide a solid foundation for your world-building endeavors.
